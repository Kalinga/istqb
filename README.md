# error, defect, fault, failure,(mistake and bug)

+ [CM Manager/ Developer] error (mistake) [Program Code/ Document]->  defect (fault, bug)
+ defect (fault, bug)-> [Execution] ->Failure [Observed during testing]


    Defects in software, systems or documents may result in failures, but not all defects do so.
    

1. `failure` Something that can be observed during testing.
2. `fault` From the perspective of the configuration adding a wrong version is a
fault, (most probably based on a mistake by the developer / CM manager)
3. `Mistake` The developer misinterpreted: 

+ __Defects occur because:__
  + human beings are fallible 
  + time pressure, 
  + complex code, 
  + complexity of infrastructure, 
  + changing technologies, 
  + many system interactions.

- __Failures can be caused by environmental conditions as well__
  - radiation 
  - magnetism 
  - electronic fields 
  - pollution can cause faults in firmwar

- __Role of Testing in SW Life cycle__
  - reduce the risk of problems occurring during operation
  - quality of the software system
  - meet contractual requirements
  - legal requirements, 
  - industry-specific standards.
